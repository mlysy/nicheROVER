Description: This package uses a probabilistic method to calculate niche
    regions and pairwise niche overlap using multidimensional niche indicator
    data (e.g., stable isotopes, environmental variables, etc.). The niche
    region is defined as the joint probability density function of the
    multidimensional niche indicators at a user-defined probability alpha
    (e.g., 95%).  Uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework, and the
    method can be extended to three or more indicator dimensions.  It provides
    directional estimates of niche overlap, accounts for species-specific
    distributions in multivariate niche space, and produces unique and
    consistent bivariate projections of the multivariate niche region.  The
    article by Swanson et al. (Ecology, 2015) provides a detailed
    description of the methodology.  See the package vignette for a worked
    example using fish stable isotope data.
