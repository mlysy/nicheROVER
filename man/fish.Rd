\description{
A dataset containing values for three stable isotopes measured in the muscle tissue of four species of arctic fish. For use in examples.
}
\details{
This dataset contains delta^{15}N, delta^{13}C, and delta^{34}S values for the following fish species:
\itemize{
\item ARCS - Arctic Cisco (\emph{Coregonus autumnalis}), \eqn{n = 69}.
\item BDWF - Broad Whitefish (\emph{Coregonus nasus}), \eqn{n = 71}.
\item LKWF - Lake Whitefish (\emph{Coregonus clupeaformis}), \eqn{n = 67}.
\item LSCS - Least Cisco (\emph{Coregonus sardinella}), \eqn{n = 70}
