\title{Plot for 2-d projection of niche regions}
\usage{
niche.plot(niche.par, niche.data, alpha = 0.95, species.names, iso.names, col,
  ndens = 512, pfrac = 0, xlab)
}
\arguments{
\item{niche.par}{a list of length \code{nspecies}, each element of which in turn is a list with elements \code{mu} and \code{Sigma}.  Each of these will correspond to an ellipse being drawn for that species in the corresponding 2-d plane. See Example.}

\item{niche.data}{a list of length \code{nspecies}, each element of which is a matrix with observations along the rows and niche indicators (e.g., stable isotopes) along the columns.}

\item{alpha}{size of the niche region to plot. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{species.names}{names of the species. Defaults to \code{names(niche.par)}.}

\item{iso.names}{names of the niche indicators (or isotopes) to plot. Defaults to \code{colnames(niche.par)}.}

\item{col}{vector of colours in which each species will be drawn.}

\item{ndens}{number of points at which to evaluate kernel density estimates.}

\item{pfrac}{fraction of the plot on which to display 1-dimensional raw niche indicator data. \code{pfrac = 0} means don't display the raw data in 1-d.}

\item{xlab}{title of plot, located on the bottom.  Defaults to no title.}
}
\value{
Returns a series of plots displaying niche indicator data and their probabilistic niche projections.
}
\description{
For one or more species, creates a series of plots: i) the raw niche indicators (e.g., stable isotope) data,
ii) their density estimates, and iii) 2-dimensional projections of probabilistic niche regions based on \eqn{n}-dimensionsional data.
}
\details{
A set of plots is created for each pairwise combination of niche indicators.
Below the diagonal are scatterplots for each species, above the diagonal are ellipses corresponding to 2-d projections of the probabilistic niche regions.  The diagonal displays density estimates for each indicator, and optionally the raw 1-d data.
See Swanson et al. (2014) for detailed description of the probabilistic niche region.
